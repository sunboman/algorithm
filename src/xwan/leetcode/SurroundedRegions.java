/**
 * 130. Surrounded Regions
 *
 * Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

 A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

 For example,
 X X X X
 X O O X
 X X O X
 X O X X
 After running your function, the board should be:

 X X X X
 X X X X
 X X X X
 X O X X

public class SurroundedRegions {
    public static void solve(char[][] board) {
        if (board == null || board.length == 0 || board[0].length == 0) return;
    }
}
